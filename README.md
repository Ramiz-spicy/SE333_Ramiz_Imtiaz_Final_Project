## Project Overview

This project implements a fully autonomous AI software engineering agent using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  
The agent automatically analyzes, edits, tests, and improves a Java Maven codebase through iterative development cycles.

The agent is capable of:

- Automated JUnit test generation  
- Iterative test improvement based on coverage  
- Bug detection and automated repair  
- Boundary value test case creation  
- Java security vulnerability scanning  
- Full Git workflow automation  
- Pull request generation using GitHub CLI  

This project demonstrates an AI-driven, end-to-end software development loop designed to enhance software quality, stability, and reliability.
